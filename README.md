# Web Portfolio 🌎
This is my personal web portfolio made using modern technologies like React and TypeScript. It is designed to look good on all screen sizes, including phones, tablets, and computers. The website includes information about me, my skills, and some of the projects I have worked on. It also has a contact section so people can reach me easily. I built this portfolio to share my work and to show what I can do as a web developer.
